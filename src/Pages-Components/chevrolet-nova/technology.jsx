          <h2>1969 Chevrolet Nova Coupe(Chevy II)'s Technology</h2>
          <p>
            The 427 was available with a 1282 ft³/min (605 L/s) Rochester
            3X2-barrel carburetors arrangement, which the factory called Tri-Power
            producing 435 bhp (441 PS; 324 kW) at 5800 rpm and 460 lb⋅ft (624 N⋅m)
            at 4000 rpm of torque.The ultimate Corvette engine for 1967 was coded
            L88, even wilder than the L89, and was as close to a pure racing
            engine as Chevy had ever offered in regular production. Besides the
            lightweight heads and bigger ports, it came with an even hotter
            camshaft, stratospheric 12.5:1 compression, an aluminum radiator,
            small-diameter flywheel, and a single huge Holley four-barrel
            carburetor. Although the factory advertised L88 rating was 430 bhp at
            4600 rpm, the true rating was said to be about 560 bhp at 6400 rpm.
            The very high compression ratio required 103-octane racing fuel, which
            was available only at select service stations. Clearly this was not an
            engine for the casual motorist. When the L88 was ordered, Chevy made
            several individual options mandatory, including Positraction, the
            transistorized ignition, heavy-duty suspension, and power brakes, as
            well as RPO C48, which deleted the normal radio and heater to cut down
            on weight and discourage the car's use on the street. As costly as it
            was powerful – at an additional $1,500 over the base $4,240.75 price –
            the L88 engine and required options were sold to a mere 20 buyers that
            year. With potential buyers anticipating the car's overdue redesign,
            sales for the Sting Ray's final year totaled 22,940, down over 5,000
            units from 1966 results. Meanwhile, Chevrolet readied its
            third-generation Corvette for the 1968 model year.
